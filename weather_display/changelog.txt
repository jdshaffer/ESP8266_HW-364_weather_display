Weather Display for HW-364a and HW-364b
Changelog
----------------------------------------


Version 1.0
   - The current program displays weather information for Shizuoka, Japan
     which is where I live. Hi!
   - The word "Time" displayed at the top of the screen is the "Update Time",
     when the data was last updated. It is set to update every 15 minutes.
   - Displays text at 2x for readability.


Version 1.1
   - Made some cosmetic changes to the display formatting.


Version 1.2
   - Prettified the data being displayed
   - Added display feedback to the boot and network connection process
   - Added code to attempt a set number of wi-fi connection attempts
   - Added code to fail gracefully upon connection failure
        (It displays a helpful warning and halts the program)
   - Added code to force the WiFi to completely reset before connecting
        (I'm having wi-fi issues after a low-power related wi-fi crash)
   - Changed refresh to every 30m to be even more power efficient


Version 1.3
   - Added a short delay after successful wifi-connect to allow
     wi-fi to finish connecting properly before fetching the internet
     time. I was getting some fetch errors which gave me an update time
     of 09:00 (basically 00:00 plus my +9 hours offset being added for
     being in Japan (done in code).
   - Simplified the message-display code to use a single function that 
     takes in the message, text size (1 or 2), and message duration in
     seconds.
   - Debugged some wi-fi connection issues by forcing wifi to turn off
     completely after waking from sleep, then turning it on again.
   - Added debugging code to help diagnose connection problems.
   - Added a feature where the user is prompted to boot into debugging 
     mode by pressing the FLASH button within 2 seconds at boot. 
   - Debugging mode adds a little dot to the bottom right corner of the
     display in both normal text-size mode and large text-size mode.
