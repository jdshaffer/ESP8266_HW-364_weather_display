About large_text_to_screen.cpp
-------------------------------------


This program shows how to write text to the built-in OLED display.

Only one library (for the display) is necessary.

Because the text is double-size, the screen can only display 10 characters wide and 4 lines up-and-down.

No other special notes are necessary for this program.
