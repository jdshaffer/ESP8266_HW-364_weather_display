How to Get Started with the HW-364a and HW-364b
------------------------------------------------


Here are some detailed steps to help you get it up and running on your HW-364a device:

(1) Install "Arduino IDE"
    https://www.arduino.cc/en/software


(2) Add the development board to the list of available boards in the IDE
    - Open "Settings"
    - In the Settings window, locate the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field. 
    - Add the following URL to this field: 
      http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
    - Click "OK" to close the Preferences window.
    - Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager....
    - In the Boards Manager, type "ESP8266" into the search bar. 
    - You will see an entry for "ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community".
    - Click on it and then click the "Install" button to install the latest 
      version of the ESP8266 core for Arduino.
    - After the installation is complete, go to Tools > Board and scroll down 
      to the "ESP8266 Boards" section.
    - Select "Generic ESP8266 Board."

(3) Connect your HW-364a of HW-364b (ESP8266) board to your computer

(4) Double-check that these settings in the Arduino IDE are correct:
    - Board: "Generic ESP8266 Module"
    - Port: Ensure the correct COM port is selected. (Mine has the keyword "USB" in it)
    - Upload Speed: "115200"
