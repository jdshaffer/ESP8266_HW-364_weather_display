Weather Display for HW-364a and HW-364b
Changelog
----------------------------------------


Version 1.0
   - The basic program.


Version 1.1
   - Made some cosmetic changes to the display formatting.


Version 1.2
   - Prettified the data being displayed
   - Added display feedback to the boot and network connection process
   - Added code to attempt a set number of wi-fi connection attempts
   - Added code to fail gracefully upon connection failure
        (It displays a helpful warning and halts the program)
   - Added code to force the WiFi to completely reset before connecting
        (I'm having wi-fi issues after a low-power related wi-fi crash)
   - Changed refresh to every 30m to be even more power efficient


Version 1.3
   - Debugging some wi-fi connection issues by forcing wifi completely
        off and on after waking from sleep before reconnecting
   - Added some debugging code that can be turned on in the config
        (change "bool debugging" to "true")
   - Debugging mode adds a little dot in the bottom right of the display
   - Simplified the message-display code to use a single function that 
     takes in the message, text size (1 or 2), and message duration in
     seconds.
   - Also added a short delay after successful wifi-connect to allow
     wi-fi to finish connecting properly before fetching the internet
     time. I was getting some fetch errors which gave me an update time
     of 09:00 (basically 00:00 plus my +9 hours offset being added for
     being in Japan (done in code).
   - Added a feature where it asks if the user wants to boot into 
     debugging mode by pressing the FLASH button at boot (only 2s wait).
