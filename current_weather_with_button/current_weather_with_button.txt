About current_weather_with_button.cpp
---------------------------------------


Notes about this program:
    - The current program displays weather information for Shizuoka, Japan
      which is where I live. Hi!

    - The weather is set to update every 15 minutes
      (but you can change this in the code)

    - Pressing the "Flash" button will make the text 2x larger,
      but also display a simplified version of the weather data




---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to get "current_weather_with_button" to run on your HW-364a or HW-364b
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Be sure you have completed the "How to Get Started" instruction

(2) Install the necessary libraries into Arduino IDE
    - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries...
    - Then search for each of these libraries and click "Install" for each:
      ESP8266 Board Support Package
      ESP8266WiFi
      ESP8266HTTPClient
      ArduinoJson
      Adafruit GFX Library
      Adafruit SSD1306

(3) Connect your HW-364a or HW-364b (ESP8266) board to your computer


(4) Double-check that these settings in the Arduino IDE are correct:
    - Board: "Generic ESP8266 Module"
    - Port: Ensure the correct COM port is selected.
      (Mine has the keyword "USB" in it)
    - Upload Speed: "115200"
    - Flash Size: "1MB (FS:64KB OTA:~470KB)"
    - Erase Flash: "Only Sktech"

(5) Update the program to work with your WiFi network
    - Change the filename from current_weather_with_button.cpp to 
      current_weather_with_button.ino
      (An ino file is basically a cpp file, but it's the name the IDE uses.)
    - Open current_weather_with_button.ino in Arduino IDE
    - Find the place where it says "Wi-Fi network credentials" and
      replace "Your SSID Goes Here" with your network SSID (keep the "  "), 
      and replace "Your WiFi Password Goes Here" with your WiFi password
      (again, keep the "  ").
    - Change the latitude and longitude given in the long URL (found
      in the section named "Open-Meteo API Configuration"). You can
      find your latitude and longitude by finding your home with Google
      Maps (web browser) and look at the URL.
    - You might need to change away from the Japan weather model, I'm not
      sure as I never tried to see what would happen if I looked up a
      location outside of Japan. See Open-Meteo.com for more info.

(6) Send the program to your board
    - Click the "checkmark" button at the top left to make sure the program
      compiled correctly (make sure there are not detectable errors).
    - Click the "right arrow" button at the top left to send the program
      to your HW-364a or HW-364b board. Once loaded, it will run automatically.
